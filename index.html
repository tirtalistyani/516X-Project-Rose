										<h1> Pothole water quality</h1>
										
										<h1>Introduction</h1>
										<p>Potholes are shallow, semi-permanent, and isolated depressional area where water often stand during wet period. They are located in the northern part of the United States and some provinces in Canada due to the geological development during the deglaciation. In Iowa, these potholes have been disturbed by artificial sub-surface drainage to reduce the wetness of these depressions. Despite these changes, frequent flood events in potholes continue to occur on spring season when it is critical for crop planting.</p>
										<p>Research about agricultural potholes is limited as studies mainly focus on the ecological system and wildlife of the pothole system. Yet, alteration of drainage can significantly affect the spatial and temporal dynamics in farmed prairie potholes. Potholes are known for their function as a recharge area for excess water and the concentrated location for nutrient sources, such as phosphorus and nitrate from fertilizer. Nutrients such as phosphate and nitrate, which are possibly transported with eroded sediments and overland flow, have a high potential to fill potholes during the wet period. However, drainage provides a short-circuit route that transports collected sediment, nutrients, and water in a pothole directly to the downstream, contributing to algae blooms, eutrophication, and flooding. Therefore, it is important to understand further the dynamics of water quality and quantity in the potholes.<p>
										<p>In 2016 to 2018, the ISU pothole team conducted continuous monitoring in pothole water quality and quantity during spring and summer seasons in several potholes within the Des Moines Lobe. This project was funded by Environmental Agency Protection (EPA) and as part of the contract, our team is obligated to submit our collected data to EPA webpage. During three years of monitoring, the ISU pothole team has collected several water quality parameters, such as total suspended solids, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total phosphorus, total nitrogen, nitrate, and nitrite, and ammonia. The monitoring of water quantity in a pothole in the form of water depth data is recorded until 2020. In this project, I will apply what I have learned in the 516X class to our collected potholes' water quality and quantity data. The objectives of my project are:<p>
										
										<h1>Objectives</h1>
										<p>The objectives of this project are for:<p>
										<ul>
											<li>Facilitating data arrangement and organization from simple data into EPA format with python codes</li>
											<li>Characterizing pothole water quality and quantity</li>
											<li>Understanding the correlation between daily water quality and the maximum daily water depth in pothole </li>
										</ul>

										<h1>My Project Workflow</h1>
									</header>
									<p> This workflow explains step by step process of this project. The project starts by collecting and organizing data. Pothole water quality and quantity data are scattered in several files, therefore it is important to gather the data in organized file before modeling. Besides, the ISU pothole team needs to submit its the water quality data to the EPA. I make a python codes that possibly help to organize the data into one EPA format excel. The organize data, then, is used for linear regession modeling using Python.<p>
